/* The "clearFix" class is used for clearing the main menu items because they
   are left-floated for horizontal main menus and we have to clear them if our main
   menu is relatively positioned (as in this example) so that the main menu box
   takes its place correctly on the page. We have to apply this class to the parent
   DIV of the root UL of our menu tree. Please take a look at section 6.1 in the
   SmartMenus User's Manual for a detailed explanation if you like. */
