Description:
    The ajax scaffold generator creates a controller to interact with a model.
    If the model does not exist, it creates the model as well. Unlike the
    standard scaffold, the ajax scaffold generator uses AJAX.

    The generator takes a model name, an optional controller name, and a
    list of views as arguments.  Scaffolded actions and views are created
    automatically.  Any views left over generate empty stubs.

    If a controller name is not given, the plural form of the model name
    will be used.  The model and controller names may be given in CamelCase
    or under_score and should not be suffixed with 'Model' or 'Controller'.
    Both model and controller names may be prefixed with a module like a
    file path; see the Modules Example for usage.

Example:
    ./script/generate ajax_scaffold Account Bank debit credit

    This will generate an Account model and BankController with a full test
    suite and a basic user interface.  Now create the accounts table in your
    database and browse to http://localhost/bank/ -- voila, you're on Rails!

Modules Example:
    ./script/generate ajax_scaffold CreditCard 'admin/credit_card' suspend late_fee

    This will generate a CreditCard model and CreditCardController controller
    in the admin module.
