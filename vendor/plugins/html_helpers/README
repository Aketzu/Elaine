HtmlHelpers 1.0
===============

This plugin gives you two useful helpers for your views and/or helpers:

* encode_entities: Encodes a UTF-8 string into a string with HTML entities such as:

>> <%= encode_entities("Über geek") %>
=> "&Uuml;ber geek"

* decode_entities: Decodes a string with HTML entities into a UTF-8 string such as:

>> <%= decode_entities("&Uuml;ber geek") %>
=> "Über geek"

Update: This plugin no longer extends the String class with encode_entities and decode_entities methods. This should hopefully make some Rails purists happy ;-) (Thanks Paul)

Note: Don't feed the helpers with anything else but UTF-8. If you really need to, convert your string to UTF-8 first using Iconv (http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/iconv/rdoc/index.html)

A basic test unit is included.
